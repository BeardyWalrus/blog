Select and engage in a community

To complete this task:

Identify a community of practitioners that aligns with your interests and aspirations for the future.
Create an ethnography report, no more than 800 words long, that is based on ‘participation observation.’
The term ‘report’ is used here to align with the description above. However, we are not expecting a formal scientific report. Instead, this activity can be done in quite an informal manner and does not need to be too labour-intensive.

As suggested in the quote above, this report should include observations about:

- The tone and language used by members of the community.
- Activities and behaviours such as social gatherings and events.
- The types and modes of interaction.
- Patterns and rules of the community.
