I am now in the middle of week 2 of the second rapid ideation session. I am focusing on building an interactive artefact.

My main goal is to eclipse my previous attempt, improve the usefulness of my UI design stage, and reduce the amount of redundant ideation in the early stages. This should be measurable by having a functional asset well before the end of the sprint. The UI prototype should resemble the final asset, and a roadmap should exist for the future development of the game.

I have decided to take a more direct approach, reducing the amount of time spent upfront, based on my previous sprint experience where too much time was spent in ideation and design.

While I am more than 50% through the sprint, I have more than eclipsed my previous sprint. I have observed that a much simpler flow diagram made the UI prototyping significantly more focused. The development of a mood board assisted with the identification of future problems. Specifically, the lack of game art, which resulted in additional research into game assets and the purchase of a paid-for asset pack to assist in the rapid prototype of the game.

With a more focused approach to the design, I have been able to gain, not only a wider understanding of the design tools, but a much deeper understanding of the development process as a whole, and a view into how the mood board, flow chart, and UI toolkits connect into the development process, as on multiple occasions I have referred back to the UI or flow chart, and refined them based on learnings at the development level.
