And a problem solved. Which blogging platform to choose? Clearly, I chose Medium. Why? Well, I love WordPress. I’ve used it for years and built multiple websites, plugins and themes. It can do so much, and that is pretty much the reason for choosing Medium. I don’t want to get distracted by all things it can do.

I often reflect on the KISS principle. Keep It Simple, Stupid. Don’t overthink it. Build for what you need now, not the endless list of things you might want to do in the future. Do I expect to maintain this site for the indefinite future? Unlikely. Does it suit my needs right now, tonight? Absolutely. Then do it. Worry about the next set of challenges when they are in front of you. You can always refactor.

Now, onto the next challenge.
