This week's challenge is to make an Avatar out of things around your home that must tell a story, or mean something to you.

## Research:

I think it’s useful to consider the things I thought about including, but did not make the cut.

* **My two dogs.** They wouldn’t sit still. I could have waited until they fell asleep, but they’re always interested in anything that’s going on, I wouldn’t have been able to get a good shot.

* **My PC / Workstation.** A number of other students took this approach, and while I think I have an interesting PC setup, and I do spend a lot of time at it, its a personal space, a refuge, and I don’t feel entirely comfortable sharing it. Neil Gaiman said that to be truly creative, you have to put yourself into your work. I’m still on that path.

* **Energy Drinks, Vitamins.** I have never been a morning person. I am significantly more effective in the afternoon, often hitting the zone between 3–6pm. I had the pleasure of working for a manager who understood software developers, and let us work our own hours. Those were my most productive years by far. These were removed as they didn’t add to the core narrative.

* **Quadcopter Drone.** I enjoy gadgets, understanding how they work, and building my own from scratch. A few years ago I built a 3d printer and a number of FPV (first-person view) racing drones from open-source parts. I had a lot more fun building and trouble shooting them, than flying them. I sold them before moving to a new job on the East Coast of the US. I kept the commercial drone, but alone, it doesn’t tell the full story.


## The Result:

The common theme - “Unfinished projects”. Working on improving my known limitations, a theme driving my participation in further education.
