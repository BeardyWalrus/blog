Reflecting on reflection, the topic of this week. To improve, you have to look back at yourself; this applies to the skill of looking back at yourself—a little meta, or recursive, which also tends to lead to the most efficient process.

A quick audit and categorization of my reflective writing so far leaves me with the following count.

* [Cognitive]( {{ site.baseurl }}/tags#cognitive) - 1
* [Procedural]( {{ site.baseurl }}/tags#procedural) - 2
* [Affective]( {{ site.baseurl }}/tags#affective) - 1
* [Dispositional]( {{ site.baseurl }}/tags#dispositional) - 1
* [Interpersonal]( {{ site.baseurl }}/tags#interpersonal) - 0

I do seem to be missing out on the Interpersonal domain a little, and upon reflection, communication is an area I do struggle with, and I think that most of my problem solving and decision making skills tend do be social oriented, in that, I like to talk them through before coming to a final decision or solution.

It was also apparent that my Affective domain reflection is relatively weak. While I do consider my emotions, I do not find that they help with learning, and for the most part dismiss them, as my success has often been in spite of my emotions and feelings suggesting that a particular course of action, or decision may be incorrect.

I’m going to focus on the SMART goals in my next blog, which will focus on this sprints slow game Jam.
