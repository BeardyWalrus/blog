Narrative: 3
Art Direction: 2
Animation: 1
Level Design: 0
Sound Design: 0


1) I've been programming for 20 years now, so this is a skill I already possess to a suitable level. Narrative design is probably my second most capable area, as I currently work in marketing, and this is a significant piece of my day job. 

2) I'm interested in improving my game design skill. In the last module, I got caught up in the engine and programming elements and failed to think through the gameplay and user experience. 

3) Avoiding the Dunning-Kruger effect is something I've been mindful of for a while. I think I suffer more from imposter syndrome, and consider myself a hermit of the fraudsters cavern (https://maekan.com/2019/11/how-to-avoid-climbing-up-mount-stupid-or-into-the-fraudsters-cave/). My target skill shape would be something amounting to an inverted pyramid, that is, not a deep specialist in any one subject, but focusing in deeper in one area, and improving the supporting skills around it.
