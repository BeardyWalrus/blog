What is success for you
what were key takeaway points
what did I learn
What happened
what went well
what didn't go well
why did that happen
what did I learn
what do I do to make that not happen again

Objectives:
how are you going to validate your goals?
Try new things - not sticking to things I've done in the past
Understand your weaknesses
define a plan of action to overcome them

What do you want to get out of this activity


The artifact you choose to develop should take the form of something that is aligned with your goals


a completed app game tool prototype
an experiment of different ways to approach a design
a better understanding of the tools
insight into your skill levels
discerning the gaps in your knowledge


leave your comfort zone
dive into it head first
produce an interactive artefact
not assessed on the quality of the end product, but the quality of your reflection and the direction you will undertake following the ideation activity.
