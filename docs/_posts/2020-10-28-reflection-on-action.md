**Reflect on-action** - What critical incidents led you to enrol on the course?

* A tweet from a marketeer (Peep Laja 2020) I respect indicating he does not understand why people play games and should be solving business problems instead. While I don’t agree with the premise, it made me think about the time I spend on non-productive activities.
* My wife was accepted into an MA in Illustration course, which led me to consider the option of a Master's degree.
* The company I work for has very rigid employment requirements, including a 4-year degree for my current rank for which I required CEO approval for an exception. A Master's degree is required for promotion.
* I’ve been maintaining a notebook of different game ideas for about 20 years, and need some motivation to do something with it.

**Reflect in-action** - What critical incidents, if any, are you experiencing?
* Time balance. My work is mentally exhausting and we’re in a number of project crunches right now. I am really enjoying the research and creative side of the course so far, as its something I can do away from the computer. This is causing challenges with time planning and causing concern for being able to meet my own deliverables.

**Reflect for-action** - How are the first two points shaping your outlook for the future?
* I need to make use of more agile style methodologies, in particular, ensuring that I have a fully functional project at all times, and then refining and improving when time is available.
* Make use of the skills and techniques I’m learning and apply them to my work projects to increase my practice time.
* I have been avoiding using my notebook ideas, not wanting to waste them. I will make use of these.
