Using Lee Petty's (Petty 2021) 4 step model for documenting art direction, I will lay out my upcoming untitled pirate game style. 

***Frame*** - when and where is the game set. 
- Somewhere between 1650 and 1750. The height of the pirate era. 

***Form*** - The style of the game - shapes, colours
- Simplified RPG style landscape
- Modern, hipster colour palette
- Desaturated colours draw from 1700s era art

***Focus*** - what am I doing better than other people
- The game is going to focus on detail and upgrades available
- The UI should be easy to use and encourage frequent upgrades

***Filter*** - what is the specialist view
- You play through the lens of a hipster
- Fancy beards and moustaches
- Cocktails and Kombucha are available in the inn.

### Moodboards

I decided to break the mood board into four sections. The first for selecting colours and ambience of the 1700s seascapes and ships.

The second for contemplating the filter of the game and highlighting the hipster style pirates.

The third explores options and styles for level layout and maps.

The fourth and final suggests options for indicating progression and captain rank.

### Concept Art 

While these mood boards help set the scene, having some more background helps imagine the game further. Some early sketches for tiers of ships, and visual options for showing the possible arcs of fire. 

A second area I struggle with is UI, so I tried a crazy eight to try and come up with some ideas for screen layouts. I found this particularly helpful to be able to play with different ideas and see which fit the style best. 

It also helped me think about essential components - such as a portrait, and how best to incorporate the upgrade system which will be a core component of the game. 

### Modeling

Experimenting with the asset forge application helps rapid prototype simple 3d objects and export them as sprites. I'm going to experiment with importing these into the game to improve on the grey box prototype.
