This week's challenge is to develop a target persona for one of my rapid ideation artefacts. I'm going to chose the pirate based incremental game as the target 

**Name:** Mack Davis

**Role:** IT Support Manager

**Brief description:** Mack is an overworked IT support manager at an SMB. He has some development experience and focuses on Windows and Linux server administration. His top 5 steam games are Factorio, 7 Days to Die, Civilization, Assasin's Creed - Black Flag and Screeps. He enjoys base-building, incremental games and large branching skill trees. Replayability is a crucial requirement. 

**Key quote:**
> I'm looking for something I can spend 2-3 mins playing on and feel like I am progressing. 

**Demographic information:** Mid 30's. Non-smoker. 

**User goals / needs / impediments**

As a busy IT worker, I want a game that automatically saves so that I do not have to worry about lost progression. 

As I work on-call, I want a game that does not punish users for only being able to play a little at a time, or for long periods so that it fits into my dynamic schedule. 

As a worker in a high-stress environment, I want a game that isn't overly challenging so that I can de-stress.

As a commuter, I want a game that works offline so I can play on the commute.
