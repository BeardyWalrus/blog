## Research — What makes an expert
* Guilds — Apprentice, Journeyman, Master
* Academic Education

## Ideas to follow up on

* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)

  It's a simple blog manager, themeable, with free hosting using Github pages. I love the simplicity, the idea that it’s all _'out there'_ in a git repository, and that there is little magic to have to maintain. Compare this to a full CMS, like self-hosted WordPress, where you have a constant and uphill battle with plugin and core updates, performance issues at scale and complicated development lifecycles.

* Zotero

  I love the simple bibliography and citing technology, I'm still not sure on the Falmouth — Harvard citation style I downloaded, but going to have to verify that against one of the academic support sites listed in the webinar today.
