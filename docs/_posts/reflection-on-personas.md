Explain the various agile practices in creative contexts.
Describe the envisioning process.
Explain and apply Agile estimation techniques.

- consider how persona will buy - what will deter them from buying
- where do they go and where do they trust their information from?

Components of a buyer persona include:
A first-person scenario: This is written from the persona’s perspective as if they are telling you about what and whom they’re dealing with when trying to achieve an objective that whatever you sell can help them achieve.
Objectives: These are the things they need to accomplish and are accountable for, as well as their professional aspirations.
Orientation: These are commonalities of traits evidenced across the people representative of the persona. An example might be that an engineer prefers precise technical information with sources to back up assertions.
Obstacles: These are whatever could cause the persona to stop moving toward purchase during any of the buying stages across the continuum.
Problems: Problems are the flip side of objectives. If there were no problems or challenges in the way of objectives, the persona would have already achieved them.
Questions: What are all the questions that this persona will need to have answered to make the transition from status quo to embracing change?
Keywords and Phrases: Which terms will the persona be most inclined to search for when looking for information that can help them to solve their problem or meet an objective?
Channels for Engagement: Where does this persona hang out online? What offline channels do they prefer?
Social Media Preferences: Which hashtags do they track? Which groups do they belong to? Which influencers do they follow? What type of content do they share with their networks?
Engagement scenarios: How will you attract this persona and continue to engage with them as they make progress from status quo to embracing change? What does that path look like? How do they interact with others on the buying committee that must reach consensus?
Content preferences: Which formats does the persona prefer?

> employing the "persona" framework introduced by Alan Cooper. 

> Additionally, persona constructs can be applied both as design-oriented metaphors during the development of games, and as analytical lenses to existing games, e.g. for evaluation of patterns of player behaviour.

> It is possible to see how, as Sanders correctly points out [19], all efforts aimed at
engendering defined experiences and emotions are doomed to failure since experiences and emotional responses alike are too individual, subjective and rooted in people’s past to be able to scientifically aim at re-producing them.

>  In any case, in order to apply this design method to computer games some changes are necessary. 

> Play-personas are further defined as clusters of preferential interaction (what) and navigation (where) attitudes, temporally expressed (when), that coalesce around different kinds of inscribed affordances in the artefacts provided by game designers. This means that personas can no longer just be limited to narrative descriptions of motivations, needs and desires distilled in ethnographic interviews. 

> the play-persona framework is directly useful in situations where players have more than one way to accomplish a task

> The agile movement and, more recently, the growth of lean practices are each efforts by software developers to have more influence on their own destiny

Focus Groups - Early Stage
Retrospective Surveys - Understand the audience
Beta Testing - Unstructured, bug finding
Usability Testing - Highly structured, actionable feedback.
Playtesting - combination of unstructured limited 1st hour testing, and targeted survey.

> The Four Keys unlock emotion with:
1. Hard Fun: Players like the opportunities for challenge, strategy, and problem
solving. Their comments focus on the game’s challenge and strategic thinking and
problem solving. This “Hard Fun” frequently generates emotions and experiences of
Frustration, and Fiero.
2. Easy Fun: Players enjoy intrigue and curiosity. Players become immersed in games
when it absorbs their complete attention, or when it takes them on an exciting
adventure. These Immersive game aspects are “Easy Fun” and generate emotions
and experiences of Wonder, Awe, and Mystery.
3. Altered States: Players treasure the enjoyment from their internal experiences in
reaction to the visceral, behavior, cognitive, and social properties. These players
play for internal sensations such as Excitement or Relief from their thoughts and
feelings.
4. The People Factor: Players use games as mechanisms for social experiences.
These players enjoy the emotions of Amusement, Schadenfreude, and Naches
coming fromthe social experiences of competition, teamwork, as well as opportunity
for social bonding and personal recognition that comes from playing with others.

Emotion Common Themes and Triggers
Fear 
- Threat of harm, object moving quickly to hit player, sudden fall or loss of support, possibility of pain
Surprise 
- Sudden change Briefest of all emotions, does not feel good or bad, after interpreting event this emotion merges into fear, relief, etc.
Disgust 
- Rejection as food or outside norms The strongest triggers are body products such as feces, vomit, urine, mucus, saliva, and blood.
Naches/ Kvell (Yiddish)
- Pleasure or pride at the accomplishment of a child or mentee. (Kvell is how it feels to express this pride in one’s child or mentee to others.)
Fiero (Italian)
- Personal triumph over adversity. The ultimate Game Emotion Overcoming difficult obstacles players raise their arms over their heads. They do not need to experience anger prior to success, but it does require effort.
Schadenfreude (German)
- Gloat over misfortune of a rival Competitive players enjoy beating each other especially a long-term rival. Boasts are made about player prowess and ranking.
Wonder 
- Over whelming improbability. Curious items amaze players at their unusualness, unlikelyhood, and improbability without breaking out of realm of possibilities.
