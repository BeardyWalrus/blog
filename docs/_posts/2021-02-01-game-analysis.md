## Stardew Valley

### 1. Game Mechanics
Control a player who builds and renovates a farm, goes fishing and monster hunting. Farmed ingredients can be used to cook food for health. Additional environment or monsters can be harvested for components to upgrade buildings or increase relationship standing with town residents. Multiplayer functionality allows cooperative management. 

### 2. Genre
Casual Pixel Art RPG

### 3. Player Fantasy
Building and owning a farm, getting away from the city. 

### 4. Platform and Controls
PC and console. Control the main character with a keyboard or controller. Mouse recommended for UI. 

### 5. Spatial Abstraction
Tiled RPG View. The camera pans with the player. Room changes for some scenes. 

### 6. Avatar
Animated sprite represents the player in the form of a customizable pixel art character. 

### 7. Camera Perspective
RPG Style 2.5D. The camera is centred on the player and locks when close to the side of the room. 

### 8. Goals and Scores
No overall game goal. Money is earned from selling farming harvests, and monster or environment loot. Side quests include levelling up relationships with townspeople, upgrading a town hall, and fishing. 

### 9. Progression and Variety
Unlock new map areas and quests. Each season has a different set of crops to be grown. Lower monster levels include items which can automate some elements of farming. Tiers of equipment upgrades. Additional items are available for transforming farming harvests for higher sales values. Animal husbandry is available with tiers of animals. 

### 10. Tension and Rest
The monster dungeon provides the greatest tension, depleting energy and health. There is no death, you just wake up at home. 

### 11. Obstacles and Penalties
Limited energy and time per day mean you have to focus on the most important task each day. Penalties are light for death or staying awake too long. Watering plants each day is required or they wither and die. 

### 12. Resources
Money can be earned by harvesting planted crops, certain parts of the environment or performing tasks for certain townspeople. Crafting resources can be harvested from the environment or monsters.  Energy, time and health are limited resources. 

### 13. Decisions
The player must decide which crops to plant, how many to plant and how much time to spend on the farm vs fishing, engaging with townfolk or clearing the dungeon.

### 14. Simulation and Chance
Seasons change every 28 game days, and most crops on the farm are reset. Monster levels appear to be procedurally generated and are random each time. Crop quality can be improved with fertilizers and sold for a higher price. 

### 15. Storytelling
The initial game narrative tells the story of an office worker inheriting his grandpaâ€™s farm. Additional narrative is available through interaction with the townsfolk and seasonal town activities. 

### 16. Art Direction and Style
The pixel art style is friendly and bright. The 2.5D style is simple, yet shows detail and time was spent building it. 

### 17. Animation and Visual Effects
Players and NPC have detailed pixel animations, including details for harvesting, watering and attacks. Environments are also animated. 

### 18. Sound Design
Character and environment sounds minimal, and haunting at times.  An original soundtrack was also composed by the developer. Musical tiles are available in game.
