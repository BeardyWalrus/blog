## Scenario 1
A researcher plans to interview eight artists / curators / designers for her thesis. She offers a letter of introduction about the project, gains written informed consent for the interview from each interviewee, later checks the contents of the transcription with each interviewee, allows the interviewee to withdraw comments / approve the interview record. The interviews will be used as attributed statements within the thesis. A recognised approach from oral history / social sciences / ethnography / art and design criticism and history is part of the methodology. The interviews will involve travel in the UK and abroad, the researcher has discussed her travel plans and personal safety with her supervisors.

- in person - medium
- identifably people - medium
- depending on subjects discussed, and types of art - could be high
- further questions 
  - what is the recognised approach
  - what are the questions being asked
  - how were the artists / curators / designers selected?   

## Scenario 2
A researcher plans to interview around 30 producers of legitimate graffiti at the Southbank Undercroft. Participants were to be interviewed about their opinions and ideas regarding activities and future possibilities for the Undercroft, and also where relevant, their own graffiti habits and key trends in graffiti practices.

- the target is legitimate graffiti, but they will be questioned on their own graffiti practices and habits which may stray into illegal territory - high

## Scenario 3
The research, for a practice-based PhD, involves engaging online presences in social networking sites under a pseudonym. It aims to explore the ways in which identity is constructed online. The research is such that it cannot be revealed in advance to those involved. The core of the research involves developing a community of online presences into a community of offline friends.

- no prior consent - deception - high
- can cause concern - high
- possibly illegal, or at least against TOS - high



## Low Risk 
- Everyday solo research

## Medium Risk
